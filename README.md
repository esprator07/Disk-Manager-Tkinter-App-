# Disk-Manager-Tkinter-App-
I’d like to share with you my open-source project called Disk Manager Pro, which I developed using Python and CustomTkinter. During the development process, I focused primarily on disk analysis and data management. The goal of this tool is to help users better understand and manage their storage devices.
